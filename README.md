# Data-Science-Portfolio
Here we showed some Bioinformatics data preprocessing. Preprocessing is very staright forward, 
just go ahead and run the cells. Also each code chunk is expalined by elaborated commments. Happy coding....


Part I - Preprocessing of the coronavirus inhibitor data imported from  CheMBL database.

Part II - Here we take the dataset from part 1 and use the SMILES notation to compute molecular descriptors. (before work on that download the preprocess data of part I from the google colab side bar)
